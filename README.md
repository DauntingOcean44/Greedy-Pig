#Description
The name Greedypig comes from the fact that the player is canonically a pig that is willing to risk their lives for marginal profit gains. This game was inspired by casino games like roulette and poker, where gamblers bet money in the hopes of turning a profit.

Greedypig consists of 10 matches. Each match has a quota, which is reached through wagers. Wagers are fixed amounts of money that have a set chance of succeeding (i.e $5 wager might have a 35% of being successful). The player must weigh out the pros and cons of the three wager options given every match, assessing a wager’s output to its success. In a given match, the player can make a set amount of wagers, as many as 25 or as little as 1, depending on the match. If a player falls short of the quota, they must pay the difference out of pocket. If they exceed the quota, the difference is added to their bank. The bank carries through rounds.

To win at the game, the player must not be in debt after all the matches. The player starts with $100, and either gains or loses money after every match, although the rate of gains to losses varies among matches and playthroughs. 

The logic behind the game is very simple. Every time the player chooses from one of the available wager options, the dealer also chooses from the same set of wagers, based on a probability table. If both the player and the dealer pick the same thing, the player gets nothing. If the dealer picks something different to the player, the player earns that wager. This process repeats for as many turns as there are in a given match, with successful wagers being added to the quota while unsuccessful wagers are not.

There aren’t any rules per say, as this is a video game–made in godot, so the player is forced to adhere to the way the game works. The ‘rules’ would be to select wagers and not go in debt.
