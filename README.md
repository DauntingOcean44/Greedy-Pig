The player must make the quota and outwit the dealer by choosing winning wagers every turn. Higher wagers translate to more money raked in per turn, but comes with a higher risk of being vetoed. When the player makes their wager, which is a distinct choice made from a few given options, the dealer picks a wager to veto. If the player’s wager and dealer’s veto are the same, the player does not receive any money. The player has a certain amount of turns to reach the quota, making it imperative that players choose the best strategy. To make the dealer more predictable, it is given a set amount of vetos for each wager option. This means that if a dealer is seen using one veto option multiple times, it can be inferred that it is less likely to occur on the next turn. The amount of each veto the dealer has is shown at the start of the game, but is not updated throughout. The player starts out with 100 dollars at the start of the game, and must spend a certain amount of that money to play with the dealer. For instance, on round one, the player spends 30 dollars, which now becomes their quota. They have 20 turns to reach that quota, using the three wager options of $1, $3, and $5 respectively. The player loses money through quotas, and earns money back through wagers. Players can go above the quota, which in return adds more money to their bank.
